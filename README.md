# Steps to run the file

## Requirements

 - Node 12+

## Getting Started

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone  https://github.com/ShariqueRazi/code-20210829-sharique.git

cd  


Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Running Locally

```bash
npm run app
```

## Run Tests

```bash
npm run test
```

## Have also tried to use input JSON file as parameter to input Read stream in  NoTestRun/BMI.js to handle really large JSON input and the program runs correctly as standalone but unfortunately I failed to implement test cases to return JSON object back. Learnt javascript from scratch and tried to write the code in 2-day time, but my learning couldnt come in handy for stream reader returning.
